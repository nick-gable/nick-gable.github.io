                        <li>Use the Upload Spreadsheets dialog to upload as many spreadsheets as you wish. Please upload only
                            XLSX
                            files, and <b>avoid uploading multiple files of the same name at the same time, as the bot may
                                confuse
                                them for the same file.</b></li>
                        <li>The spreadsheets uploaded may include any data you wish, but the bot is currently set to look for
                            headers in the <b>2nd row</b> of the spreadsheet, as per the format of the Loan Tape Template.</li>
                        <li>Columns do not need to be in any particular order - the bot will know what to look for and will find
                            the
                            address information no matter the format or arrangement of the columns.</li>
                        <li>On the completed spreadsheets, an "X" means that Zillow did not have a Zestimate on file for the
                            property in question, while a "?" means that the bot could not find the properties record at all. In
                            the 2nd case, this could mean that Zillow simply does not have any record of the property, or that
                            there were serious spelling or formatting mistakes in the input address.</li>
                        <li>Completed spreadsheets will have the new data added to the first empty columns on the right side of
                            the document.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Because the data that we use is subject to the terms and conditions of the Zillow API, here are a few
                        things
                        you should know:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Zillow prohibits this site from storing data that came from its API in our databases. As a result,
                            all
                            data taken from Zillow will be deleted from the server once you download it.</li>
                        <li>Per the branding terms, a column will be added to the spreadsheet that has links to all of the
                            properties pages on Zillow. Although this is required from our site, you are free to remove it as
                            you
                            wish.</li>
                        <li>Zillow is unclear as to if there is a limit of 1000 API calls per day (according to the API
                            website), or
                            5000 per hour (as stated in the terms). Regardless, if there appear to be a lot of errors in any of
                            the
                            returned spreadsheets, it is most likely due to the call limit being reached.</li>
                    </ul>
