# Work Scheduler
Program used to keep track of assignments, and other things to do.

## Setup
This is a Flask app, so simply install Flask, and run the application with `flask --app server run`. I've also included `run_server.sh`, which is the simple script I used as the target for the service `workscheduler.service` on my Ubuntu machine to run this in the background.
