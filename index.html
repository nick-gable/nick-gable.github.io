                <p>Hello! My name is Nick Gable, and I am a Computer Science senior at the University of Minnesota. This
                    page is a collection of my work I have done over the years, including personal projects as well as
                    significant work and school projects. </p>
                <p>
                    I've included source code or samples when available and
                    appropriate, but opted to hold back on some for privacy concerns. Nonetheless, I hope this page is a
                    helpful picture of what I have worked on!
                </p>

                        <h3><i>Jimmy's Game</i> AI</h3>
                        <p>For my introductory AI class final project, I implemented Monte-Carlo Tree Search to play the
                            game "Jimmy's Game", a fun and unique card game I was taught by someone in my cabin at camp
                            that I counselled. I implemented the tree search from scratch in Rust, and interfaced it to
                            a Python game environment that kept track of cards and game rule obedience.</p>
                        <p>This project is probably my single biggest in college and my proudest, as I implemented it
                            from scratch by myself (which created quite a time crunch in the fall of my junior year). As
                            far as I'm aware, the source code was never submitted, so I've included it here.

                        <p>For this project, I (along with another student), implemented a multithreaded web
                            server
                            in C. The web server uses POSIX threads, and directly accesses the Unix socket system call
                            interface to
                            respond to HTTP GET requests, utilizing and pool of dispatcher threads to process the
                            request and a pool
                            of worker threads to respond to the request with the appropriate file data. It also includes
                            an
                            implementation for a basic cache, as well as a dynamic thread pool system that adjusts the
                            number of
                            worker threads depending on the current server load.</p>

                            For a functional programming class, I implemented a rank aggregation program, which parsed
                            files of
                            votes and ballot options in order to determine the results of "elections" / votes, based off

                            formula provided in the file, parsing that formula string, applying it to every vote,
                            and checking for errors as appropriate.

                        <h3>Honors Thesis</h3>
                        <p>For my honors thesis, I tackled the problem of transit vehicle delay estimation in real
                            time - basically, the live prediction given for when a transit vehicle will arrive at a
                            specific stop. I used Graph Neural Networks to try to make network wide
                            predictions, an approach that I found scarce within urban transit networks in existing literature.</p>
                        <p>While the approach was not as successful as the existing predictions being made by Metro Transit (a hard thing to beat, considering the timeframe of my project), it nonetheless was accurate enough to show value in the approach in general. For more details, read the paper!</p>

                        <h3>Transit Lab Application Server</h3>
                        <p>For the transit lab research team I am on, I developed an internal web tool using Django that
                            contained
                            various other web applications I had developed related to data the transit team used. Some
                            of these tools included a basic database viewer, a data downloading tool, and some basic
                            visualizations.</p>
                        <p>In the fall, I developed an additional application for this system that incorporated more
                            sophisticated visualizations on Leaflet maps. These visualizations were specifically created
                            to visually show results from a grad students research on my team. One such visualization
                            required significant data pre-processing, which was done using multi-threaded Rust code
                            before being passed back to the Python-based Django application.</p>

                            using the Zillow API. The service allows (private) users to upload loan tapes in a
                            particularly
                            formatted excel spreadsheet, which it then parsed in order to get a list of properties
                            before
                            searching for those properties on the API, retrieving their Zestimate when possible, and
                            putting
                            that data back into the spreadsheet. All of this was done using a web frontend which made
                            asynchronous callbacks to a Node.js web server which did most of the processing.</p>

                        <p>"The Forge" is the name of the house I live at in college. Over winter break, I created a
                            website for our house that includes a number of different types of pages and features. It
                            runs Wagtail, which is a Django-based CMS. Our favorite feature is probably the recipe

                            split columns for ingredients and directions - something more websites should have! There is
                            also a system for event hosting that allows for guests to RSVP and register for bringing
                            food, and has a protection mechanism to share our address and other details safely without
                            them being open to the public.</p>

                        <h3>Video Cut Generator</h3>
                        <p>This project was born out of a desire to help a friend automate the process of cutting and
                            splicing many video clips from many different sources. He specifically needed to cut small
                            chunks from various sources and splice them together in order, but only knew the rough
                            timestamps of where the cuts needed to be, needing to move frame by frame in order to get
                            the exact location.</p>
                        <p>The project is split into three parts: <code>generate_cuts</code>, which takes in a CSV file
                            containing approximate timestamps and plays the video so that you can select a final cut
                            location; <code>make_cuts</code>, which actually makes the cuts based off of the output of
                            <code>generate_cuts</code>; and <code>splice</code>, which splices all of them together.
                            <code>splice</code> was never implemented, but the other two features are (and arguably are
                            the most unique part of the project anyways).

                        <h3>Websocket File Transfer</h3>
                        <p>Online P2P file transfer system that I made, which uses WebSockets to transfer files
                            from a sending end to a receiving end. This is done by having the receiving end start the
                            site, and the
                            sending end can then scan a QR code to connect to the receiver, or enter a text code into
                            the site. I
                            made this in order to facilitate an easy way to send files from my phone to my computer,
                            without needing
                            to find a cable or spend the time to login to a service like Google Drive on both devices.
                            The server
                            for this is written in Python, and the web interface in HTML/JS with Bootstrap styling.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the server that hosted this service is currently down, but the source
                            code is available!</p>
