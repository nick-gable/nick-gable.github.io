            <p class="lead">Hello! My name is Nick Gable, and I am currently studying Computer Science at the University
                of Minnesota. On this page I've organized a variety of my personal and school projects.
            <p class="lead"><i>Note: Some projects will have some or all of their source code removed to prevent
                    plagerism, protect intellectual property, or to hide sensitive parts of code that could impact the
                    security of the project/software in question.</i></p>

                <div class="col-9">
                    <p class="half-lead">I render my resume in HTML, which I then print from my web browser using
                        Chrome's
                        default printing functionality. This makes it easier to keep the style consistent when changing
                        the content, and also allows me to implement small HTML/JS controls to dynamically change the
                        content of my resume in order to visualize changes or tailor it to different applications.</p>
                    <p class="half-lead">My resume source code, written using Bootstrap as well as some pure CSS, is
                        available, as well as a PDF of my latest version.</p>

                    <h4>Zillow Bot</h4>
                    <p class="half-lead">Automated web service used to retrieve Zillow home valuation data en-masse
                        using the Zillow API. The service allows (private) users to upload loan tapes in a particularly
                        formatted excel spreadsheet, which it then parsed in order to get a list of properties before
                        searching for those properties on the API, retrieving their Zestimate when possible, and putting
                        that data back into the spreadsheet. All of this was done using a web frontend which made
                        asynchronous callbacks to a Node.js web server which did most of the processing.</p>
                    <p class="half-lead"><i>Much of this source code is private to protect the interests of the company
                            I made the bot for, but the Zillow API accessing code is available, as well as an example of
                            the front-end interface in action.</i></p>

            <h2>Notable School Projects</h2>
            <p class="lead"><i>I haven't included source code for most items here due to the ease at which it could be
                    found and plagiarized by other students, and because of the IP confusion that comes from code
                    written for a university.</i></p>
            <h4>Multithreaded Web Server</h4>
            <p class="half-lead">For this project, I (along with another student), implemented a multithreaded web
                server
                in C. The web server uses POSIX threads, and directly accesses the Unix socket system call interface to
                respond to HTTP GET requests, utilizing and pool of dispatcher threads to process the request and a pool
                of worker threads to respond to the request with the appropriate file data. It also includes an
                implementation for a basic cache, as well as a dynamic thread pool system that adjusts the number of
                worker threads depending on the current server load.</p>
            <h4>Rank Aggregator</h4>
            <p class="half-lead">
                For a functional programming class, I implemented a rank aggregation program, which parsed files of
                votes and ballot options in order to determine the results of "elections" / votes, based off of a
                formula provided in the file, parsing that formula string, applying it to every vote,
                and checking for errors as appropriate.
            </p>

            <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
            <h4>WebSocket File Transfer</h4>
            <p class="half-lead">Online P2P file transfer system that I made, which uses WebSockets to transfer files
                from a sending end to a receiving end. This is done by having the receiving end start the site, and the
                sending end can then scan a QR code to connect to the receiver, or enter a text code into the site. I
                made this in order to facilitate an easy way to send files from my phone to my computer, without needing
                to find a cable or spend the time to login to a service like Google Drive on both devices. The server
                for this is written in Python, and the web interface in HTML/JS with Bootstrap styling.</p>
            <p class="half-lead"><i>Unfortunately, the server that hosted this service is currently down, but the source
                    code is available!</i></p>
